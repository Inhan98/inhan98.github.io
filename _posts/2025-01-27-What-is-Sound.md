## 1. The Physical Characteristics of Sound

### 1A. The Nature of Sound

Sound originates from the vibration of an object. These vibrations are transmitted to the surrounding medium as a pattern of pressure changes.

The vibrations occur along an axis aligned with the direction of sound propagation, forming a wave known as a **longitudinal wave**.

### 1B. Pure Sound

A sound whose waveform is a sine wave (or sinusoidal) is called a simple tone or **pure tone**.

### 1C. Pitch

Pitch is defined as "that attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which sounds can be ordered on a scale extending from low to high."

#### 1C-1. Difference Between Pitch and Frequency

Unlike pure tones, most sounds encountered in everyday life, such as those produced by musical instruments or speech, are **complex sounds**. When these sounds exhibit regularity, they are called **periodic sounds**.

Such sounds have pitch, and the sound that evokes a pitch is often referred to as a **"tone."**

In the case of pure tones, a higher frequency corresponds to a higher pitch. However, for complex sounds, determining which frequency component defines the pitch can be challenging.

For example:

- **Amplitude Modulated (AM) Sounds:** When listening to AM sounds, humans typically perceive the **modulation frequency** as the pitch rather than the carrier frequency.
- **Musical Instruments:** Instruments such as pianos or wind instruments produce sounds containing multiple frequency components, including high-frequency overtones. Despite this, the human ear perceives only the lowest frequency component (the fundamental frequency) as the pitch.

As these examples demonstrate, frequency alone cannot fully account for the perception of a sound's highness or lowness.

Thus, the subjective term **pitch** is used to describe the perceived frequency of a sound, determining how "high" or "low" it appears to the listener.

For complex sounds, pitch is often investigated by asking subjects to adjust a sinusoidal tone until it matches the perceived pitch of the complex sound.
